    <h2>How to Make Samosa</h2>
    <p>
      Making Samosa can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the
      wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions
      in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounces yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>2/3 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
      <li>/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add potatoes to a small saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to
          a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until
          fork-tender. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; mash until mostly
          smooth with a few small chunks remaining.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the same saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook,
          stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ginger
          and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add garam masala,
          cumin, salt, and (if using) cayenne; cook about 30 seconds more. Stir
          in mashed potatoes and peas; cook until warmed through. Remove from
          heat; stir in cilantro.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Arrange wonton wrappers on a clean work surface; evenly spoon filling
          into centers of wontonwrappers. Lightly wet borders of wrappers with
          water. Fold two corners together to form triangles. Press edges to
          seal. Coat both sides of samosas with cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat air fryer
          basket with cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Working in batches if needed, arrange samosas in an even layer in the
          basket. Cook, turning once halfway through, until samosas are golden
          brown and crispy, about 8 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, combine yogurt, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice; garlic,
          salt and pepper in a small food processor; process until well
          combined. Chill, covered, up to 5 days.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Serve samosas with cilantro-yogurt sauce. Garnish with additional
          cilantro.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
